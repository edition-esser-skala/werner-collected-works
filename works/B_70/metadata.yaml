  2  & 80f & org & In \A1, org plays colla parte with S and A.
                   However, Werner noted “NB Tenor” below the staff,
                   indicating that org should rather play colla parte with T. \\
  5  & 7–9 & S   & Lyrics have been added by later hand. \\
  2* & –   & –   & This cancelled fragment of a \textit{Credo}

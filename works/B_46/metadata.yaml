    & 75  & coro & Werner's intended design of the cadence in these two bars
                   is unclear. Several variants are conceivable:
                   (1) The choral parts originally contained an authentic
                   cadence, and two half notes in bar 76 of S and A
                   were lost during copying.
                   (2) In bar 76 there was originally a rest in all
                   choral parts, so that the missing tonic corresponded
                   to the text “non erit finis”. In this case, the copyists
                   would have only corrected T and B to a “correct” cadence,
                   but not S and A.
                   (3) The original version corresponded to the one
                   shown in this edition. \\

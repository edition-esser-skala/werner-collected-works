  –  & –  & vla  & In \B1, there is no staff for vla in movements 7, 9, 10,
                   15, 17, 20–22, 26, and~28. Here, a vla part has been added
                   by the editor to these movements.
                   In arias (no. 7, 9, 17, 21, and 26), the vla plays in unison
                   with bc whenever the voice pauses during the first section.
                   In accompagnatos (no. 10, 20, and 22), it plays
                   unison with bc.
                   In choruses (no. 15 and 28), it generally plays unison
                   with T~2 in fugues (except for bars 21–24 of no. 15, where
                   it plays unison with T~1), and unison with bc otherwise.
                   Note that no vla part has been added to no. 24,
                   since the soloist never pauses during the first section. \\

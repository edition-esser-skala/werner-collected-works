  – & –    & –    & Minor differences between \A1 and \B1 occur in all parts.
                    Notably, the timp parts of the two sources differ to a
                    greater extent, and the part of \A1 is more virtuosic.
                    Here, none of these differences are annotated. \\
    & –    & –    & In \A1 and \B1, punctuated rhythms involving a
                    \sixteenthNoteDotted\ typically comprise \thirtysecondNote,
                    i.e., 16.–32–32 or 32–32–16. Here, these rhythms are
                    reproduced as 16.–64–64 and 64–64–16., respectively. \\
    & –    & org  & The title page of \A1 contains the note “NB In defectu
                    Clarinorum Organum Clarinum concertantem supplet”.
                    Accordingly, the org part of \A1 also contains the solo
                    parts of clno 1 in the \textit{Quoniam} and
                    \textit{Pleni sunt cœli}. Here, these organ solos are
                    reproduced in the org part as an appendix to the
                    respective movement. \\

  – & –    & –      & Title page and available parts indicate that the work
                      can be performed with alternative instruments:
                      (1) The part for vla 1 and trb 1 can either be played
                      (a) continuously by one instrument, or (b) divided between
                      the two (part title: “Viola e Trombone~1 in Compendio”;
                      title page: “vel 2 Viola et Tromb. in Compendio”).
                      The same applies to the pair vla/trb~2.
                      In this edition, the sections to be played by the
                      respective instruments are marked by their
                      respective abbreviations. Moreover, this edition
                      reproduces solely the “compendio” parts, while minor
                      rhythmic differences that appear in the separate parts
                      are ignored.
                      (2) High wind instruments either comprise
                      (a) two cornets and two clarions or
                      (b) only two clarions, which then also
                      play some sections of the cornets (title page:
                      “vel 2. Clarini et 2. Cornet si placet”).
                      In this edition, parts for version (a) are written
                      in a single staff group at the top of the score,
                      while clno parts for version (b) are written
                      on a separate staff and labeled “clno*”. \\
  – & –    & –      & In \B1 (but not in \B2), whole notes in hemiolas are
                      frequently (but inconsistently) written with filled,
                      stemless note heads (Gloria: bars 46f, 51f, 57f, 74f,
                      92f, 99f, and 135f; Credo: 12f, 18f, 25f, 29f, 33f, 43f, 49f, 56f, 106f, 115f, 118f, 135f, 138f, 161f, 204f, 209f, and 214f). This notation has been tacitly
                      emended to the modern convention. \\

                      (vla/trb 1, vla 1, trb 1, vla/trb 2, vla 2, trb 2, vlne,
                      org), “Allegro” (S solo, A solo, T solo, B solo, S coro,
                      cnto 1, cnto 2, clno 1*, trb 3, vl 1, vl 2, mdc),
                      or no tempo indication (A coro, T coro, clno 1, clno 2,

                      on the 1st \halfNote\ (A solo, A coro, trb 1),
                      but \natural f″4 on the 2nd \quarterNote\
                      (S solo, S coro, vl 2). \\
    & 159  & –      & In \B1, parts consistently play \sharp f′2

                      but \natural f″4 on the last \quarterNote\
                      (S solo, S coro, cnto 2, clno 2, vl 2). \\
    & 163  & –      & In \B1, all parts except clno 1/2, clno* 1/2, and timp
                      contain a final bar with a full measure rest.
                      However, only clno 1/2* play in this final bar,
                      while clno 1/2 and timp parts end after 162 bars.
                      Thus, it is unclear which instruments should play
                      in the final bar if version (2a) is performed. \\

    & 101–126 & –   & These bars only appear in the trb/vla 1/2 parts,
                      but neither in the vla 1/2 nor trb 1/2 parts.
                      Since vl 1/2 pause in the sonata, however, it is likely
                       that this section should be played by trb 1/2. \\
    & 138  & vla 1  & 3rd \halfNote\ in \B1: e′2 \\
    & 141  & –      & In \B1, this bar is missing in both
                      the trb/vla 1 and vla 1 part. \\
